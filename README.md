Live Age and Gender Estimation in the Wild
===============================

Implementation of a real-time age and gender estimator from webcam images. Uses opencv haarcascade to detect faces and estimates the age using Deep Features (age net: Rothe and Timofte and Van Gool, IJCV2016; gender net: Levi and Hassner, CVPR2015).

Requirements:

* Caffe (with pycaffe interface)
* OpenCV (with python interface)
* Nvidia GPU
